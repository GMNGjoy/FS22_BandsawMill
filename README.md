# Bandsaw Mill
I've been a woodworker for years now, and if I had the space - I'd totally want to get one of these WoodMizer LT-15 bandsaw mills (or even an LT-70!). When I saw this bandsaw mill first in the Platinum Edition my first thought was ... if you're going to have a shed that big - you should have used the LT-70. The LT-15 is more of a "homestead" sized sawmill, intended to either be out in the elements, or used for someone just getting into milling. That's what I've attempted to create here with this mod.

This mod is PC-only due to a script (that is similar to the same script that Giants uses) to map the `$pdlc` path to where you have installed your dlc's. Ideally, this could be all platforms, if that script was included the basegame.

... and the other reason I didn't like using the shed-mill thing that was included in the Platinum Edition - if you have a bandsaw mill - you're not going to be making "prefab walls"... that's just plain unrealisitc. Shame on you, Giants!


## Description from the ModDesc
